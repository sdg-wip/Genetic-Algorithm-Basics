# Genetic-Algorithm-Basics
Genetic algorithms are a subset of evolutionary algorithms, which itself is a subset of evolutionary computation.Genetic algorithms simulate the process of natural selection which means those species who can adapt to changes in their environment are able to survive and reproduce and go to next generation.
The steps for genetic algorithms:

1. ****Initialisation:*** This is the process to choose initial population. popualtion comprises of individuals which is equivalent to chromosomes in context of biology and each chromosome consists of multipple gene.

2. ***Fitness Assignment:*** Each indiviual is evaluated based on score how fit they are. This is fitness score. We can define the score according  to our problem.

3. ***Selection:*** chromosomes from our population are selected which can mate and create their off-springs. This is not based on fitness score.
General thought is that we should select the fit chromosomes and allow them to produce off-springs. But that would lead to chromosomes that are more close to one another in a few next generation, and therefore less diversity.

Different selections methods are there Roulette Wheel Selection method being one of them.

4. ***Crossover:***

5. ***Mutation:***
